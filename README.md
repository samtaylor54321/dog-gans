Kaggle Generative Dogs!

Use your training skills to create images, rather than identify them. You’ll be using GANs, which are at the creative frontier of machine learning. 
You might think of GANs as robot artists in a sense—able to create eerily lifelike images, and even digital worlds.

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning system invented by Ian Goodfellow in 2014. Two neural networks compete with each other
in a game. Given a training set, this technique learns to generate new data with the same statistics as the training set. In this competition, you’ll be 
training generative models to create images of dogs. Only this time… there’s no ground truth data for you to predict. Here, you’ll submit the 
images and be scored based on how well those images are classified as dogs from pre-trained neural networks.
